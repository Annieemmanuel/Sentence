# Sentence
The code uses BERT model to find the similarity between different sentences. It tries to calculate the vector embeddings of each sentence and then calculates the cosine similarity. The value of the cosine similarity index tells us how much similar two different senetences are with 0 being the least similar and 1 being the most similar
